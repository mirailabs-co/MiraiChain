# Token Mapper

To transfer funds between Mirai Chain and other chains (Ethereum, Avalanche C-Chain, Polygon, ...), a connection between the contract addresses used for minting or burning tokens must be established. This link is recorded in a certain repository (contract) so that the blockchain knows which token is being transferred from one Network to another.

### How To Submit A Mapping Request

-   Step 1: Go to [https://mapper.miraichain.io/map](https://mapper.miraichain.io/map) and click the Map New Token button in the top right corner.
